Certainly! Another way to make your Python script run on startup is by using the cron scheduler. Here's how you can set it up:

Open the crontab configuration for editing:

bash
Copy code
crontab -e
Add a line to the crontab file to run your Python script on startup. For example:

bash
Copy code
@reboot /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/bot/script.py
This line uses the @reboot directive, which means the specified command will be run once at system startup.

Save the file and exit the editor.
